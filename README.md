When you create a new file in Windows,for example, a txt file using Notepad,
by default, the file is named "New Text Document,"
and for subsequent files,a number in parentheses is added, like "New Text Document (1)."
In many cases, this type of naming does not provide any information about the file.
Using the code prepared in three files,
an option will be added to the Windows right-click menu that creates a file named with the current date and time, for example:
20250709_113535,
so that at least the creation date and time of the file are clearly indicated.
This allows files to be sorted and organized based on their creation time when needed,
especially useful when edits have been made on the files over different days.
 
After extraction, the files should be moved to a Windows folder,
and then the file with the .reg extension should be double-clicked
to add the new option to the right-click context menu.
